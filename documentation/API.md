# API-Call Documentation
## Introduction
As many of us know YSFReflectors use the YSF protocol to communicate with endpoints. These original commands are well 
documented at http://ycs-wiki.xreflector.net/doku.php?id=start:protocols:ysf  thanks to the YCS-team for hosting them.
pYSFReflector has also an extended set of commands you can use for fetching information on the state of different things 
when running the reflector.

This document will show the commands, and the replies expected from the reflector.

## How To Issue A Call
First it is very easy to have a command sent to a reflector. Simply use a command similar to this:

`echo -n "YSFS" | nc -u 127.0.0.1 42000 -w 2 && echo`

or in a more general form:

`echo -n "<COMMAND>" | nc -u <IP-ADDRESS_OF_REFLECTOR> <PORT_OF_REFLECTOR> -w 2 && echo`

This line will send the chosen command to the reflector and prints out its reply.

## List Of Extended API-Commands
Here we will not describe the standard-commands in the YSF protocol, but the extended command set by the pYSFReflector.

The format of the answer will be the corresponding answer-code, and some values separated by `:` for each object in scope. 
Several objects are separated by `;`.
